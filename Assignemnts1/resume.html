    <li><strong>Project name:</strong> Directory Validation and Comparison Automation  </li>
    <p>Provider Single Point Plus (PSP+) is a workflow and contract loading application built by Humana IT. It is being migrated into Accelerated Provider Exchange (APEX) which is being developed in PEGA BPM tool. The purpose of this project is to automate the process of identifying contracted providers in CAS (Claims Adjudication System) and MTV (Metavance) that are NOT printing in directories. These reports would strengthen Humanaâ€™s ability to provide more complete and accurate, provider directories to their members. <br>
    <li><strong>Responsibilites:</strong></li>
        As a specialist for Humana, I identified problems with current provider data in payer systems. Analyzed provider data in payor systems,including, CAS, Metavance, PIMS, CIS, and multiple internet resources. Processed providers in the directory called PIMS, keeping demographics up-to-date with removal of duplicate provider information.
